# Github Cal LED Text
> The javascript code is based on [cal-heatmap](http://kamisama.github.com/cal-heatmap/), thanks for the [神様](http://kamisama.github.com/)'s fantastic work.

Just open index.html and input the word you want to display on your [Github contribution calendar](https://github.com/blog/1360-introducing-contributions), and it will calculate which date you need to commit, and if you want some gradient effect, it will tell you how many times you need to commit.
