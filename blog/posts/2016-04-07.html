    <div class="poem">
    <label>Where dips the rocky highland</label>
    <p>Of Sleuth Wood in the lake,<br/>
      There lies a leafy island<br/>
      Where flapping herons wake<br/>
      The drowsy water rats;<br/>
      There we’ve hid our faery vats,<br/>
      Full of berrys<br/>
      And of reddest stolen cherries.<br/>
      Come away, O human child!<br/>
      To the waters and the wild<br/>
      With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
      For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.</p>

    <label>Where the wave of moonlight glosses</label>
    <p>The dim gray sands with light,<br/>
      Far off by furthest Rosses<br/>
      We foot it all the night,<br/>
      Weaving olden dances<br/>
      Mingling hands and mingling glances<br/>
      Till the moon has taken flight;<br/>
      To and fro we leap<br/>
      And chase the frothy bubbles,<br/>
      While the world is full of troubles<br/>
      And anxious in its sleep.<br/>
      Come away, O human child!<br/>
      To the waters and the wild<br/>
      With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
      For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.</p>

    <label>Where the wandering water gushes</label>
    <p>From the hills above Glen-Car,<br/>
      In pools among the rushes<br/>
      That scarce could bathe a star,<br/>
      We seek for slumbering trout<br/>
      And whispering in their ears<br/>
      Give them unquiet dreams;<br/>
      Leaning softly out<br/>
      From ferns that drop their tears<br/>
      Over the young streams.<br/>
      Come away, O human child!<br/>
      To the waters and the wild<br/>
      With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
      For the world’s more full of weeping than you can understand.</p>

    <label>Away with us he’s going,</label>
    <p>The solemn-eyed:<br/>
      He’ll hear no more the lowing<br/>
      Of the calves on the warm hillside<br/>
      Or the kettle on the hob<br/>
      Sing peace into his breast,<br/>
      Or see the brown mice bob<br/>
      Round and round the oatmeal chest.<br/>
      For he comes, the human child,<br/>
      To the waters and the wild<br/>
      With a faery, hand in hand,<br/>
      For the world’s more full of weeping than he can understand.</p>
